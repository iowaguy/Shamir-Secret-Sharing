* Testing
- [ ] Create some test cases

* verify primality
- [ ] probably just decoding the message is faster than actual primality verification

* web interface
** Make keys
*** 1st iteration [0/3]
- [ ] Create user input fields for making keys
- [ ] Accept user input
- [ ] Return and display keys

*** 2nd iteration [0/2]
- [ ] send keys to emails
- [ ] choose how many keys get sent to a particular email

*** 3rd iteration [0/1]
- [ ] Allow users to email in keys and return decoded message when critical number of keys is sent in

** Decode keys [0/3]
- [ ] Create user input fields for decoding
- [ ] Accept user input
- [ ] Return decoded message

* split message; multiple key sets

* Bugs
- [ ] Sometimes doesn't work with non-consectutive keys
