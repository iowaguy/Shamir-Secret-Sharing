* Testing
- [X] Create a basic blackbox test
- [X] Test non-consecutive, unsorted keys
- [ ] Make cli test

* Core functionality
- [X] Verify primality
- [ ] Split message, multiple key sets

* Web interface
** Make keys
*** 1st iteration [0/3]
- [ ] Create user input fields for making keys
- [ ] Accept user input
- [ ] Return and display keys

*** 2nd iteration [0/2]
- [ ] send keys to emails
- [ ] choose how many keys get sent to a particular email

** Decode keys [0/3]
*** 1st iteration [0/3]
- [ ] Create user input fields for decoding
- [ ] Accept user input
- [ ] Return decoded message

*** 2nd iteration [0/1]
- [ ] Allow users to email in keys and return decoded message when critical number of keys is sent in


* Bugs
- [X] Sometimes doesn't work with non-consectutive keys
- [X] Program will loop infinitely if miller-rabin falsly reports prime, because the same number will continue to be chosen as the prime. Need to store the prime, and make sure the next prime starts from previousPrime+1.
